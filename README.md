# Atheer
A blog CMS (content management system) designed for scalability in mind. It is the second blog project I am working on as I want this to be able to be used by anyone unlike my [previous project](https://github.com/Morr0/Project-Blog). This project will emphasize backend more than frontend as I will leave the presentation as simple as possible.

Current components:

- Atheer Backend (A lambda function corresponding to **read** blog operations)
